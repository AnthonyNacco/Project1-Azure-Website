# Project1-Azure-Website
Cyber Blog Website

This was my first project in my CyberSecurity Bootcamp class. For this project, I build a basic cyberblog web application using Microft Azure Cloud Services and Docker. 
Created and stored SSL certificates in Azure’s Key Vault, and bound them to secure the web application.
Protected the web application by utilizing Azure’s Security features, such as Azure’s Front Door, WAF, and Security Center
